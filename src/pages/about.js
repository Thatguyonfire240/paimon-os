                    are we the only genshin OS made? YES but we are still the best! 
                    The best way of keeping up with the newest updates is using PaimonOS, and you can't convince us otherwise! We like to do things differently around here, we are security conscious people! No selling of user data here (looking at you winbloat)</p>
